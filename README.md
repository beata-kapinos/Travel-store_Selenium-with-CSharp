I work on this project along with the Selenium in C# and Java course by Testelka.pl <br>
I finished tests for the shopping cart and I am currently working on test for payments. Then I will write tests for coupons. <br>
Next step will be rewriting tests according to Page Object Model. 

To run this project you need to download all folders. Then you need to change paths for drivers in start_node.bat file located in "drivers..." folder. When the paths are corrected you can run file start_hub.bat and start_node.bat.
