I work on this project along with the Selenium in C# and Java course by Testelka.pl <br>
I finished tests for the shopping cart and I am currently working on tests for payments. After that I will write tests for coupons. <br>
The next step will be rewriting tests according to Page Object Model. 

To run this project you need to:
1. download all folders 
2. change paths for drivers in the start_node.bat file located in the "drivers..." 
3. run start_hub.bat and start_node.bat
